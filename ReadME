This is the VR CMS Detector Project. Currently the project only works on Oculus rift but support for the HTC Vive is coming.
Running the program requires a version of Unity3D which can be downloaded for free here https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal
After setting up Unity and downloading the repository grom GitHub open the project in Unity.
Open the scene called Oculus display and press the play button.
