This is the VR CMS Detector Project. Currently the project works on both the Oculus rift and HTC Vive. 
Additional functionality is coming for the HTC Vive.
Running the program requires a version of Unity3D which can be downloaded for free here https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal
After setting up Unity and downloading the repository grom GitHub open the project in Unity.
Depending on if you have an Oculus rift connected or an HTC Vive connected go into the scenes folder and open appropriately named scene.
